This tool takes a Python source file as input and visualizes its Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) in a scrollable window.

### How to Run:
```bash
python print_ast.py <source_file.py>
```
Replace `<source_file.py>` with the path to the Python file you want to analyze.

## 2. `molecule_visualizer.py`
This tool visualizes the 3D structure of a molecule. By default, it queries PubChem for the geometry of the molecule `BeH2` and displays its atoms and bonds in a 3D plot.

### How to Run:
```bash
python molecule_visualizer.py
```
You can modify the script to visualize other molecules by changing the default input.
